== Usage and Definition ==

The Athlos Virtual Assistant plugin will take care of inserting the Athlos virtual assistant in the frontend of your site.

The virtual assistant will make it easier for your users to reach website information with voice questions.
Expressing itself in natural language, it is possible to ask questions to the assistant who will take care of providing a vocal answer and possibly directing the user to a specific page.

Once the plugin is installed, you will have to insert the code provided by Athlos, to allow it to connect to the servers, call all the necessary files and show the avatar in frontend.

In case you want to test the assistant, you can insert the specified url in the plugin page, to show the freemium version of the avatar in the frontend.

The freemium version, unlike the dedicated versions, answers a few simple vocal questions.

For any clarification or doubt, do not hesitate to write to us on info@athlos.biz

If you want to see the complete avatar in action, connect to the site www.athlos.biz, we have a dedicated section where you can virtually test the avatar on your site without the need for installations.
